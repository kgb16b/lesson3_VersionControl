            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control remembers different versions of a file or files so that a user can refer back to them. There are a few different types of version control systems; local, centralized, and distributed. A local system utilizes a simple single database to store all changes made to files by a single computer. Then, centralized systems utilize a central server that multiple users and computers can use to view files and specific versions. Finally, distributed systems can utilize a system similar to centralized, but the other users/clients can have full copies of the repository databases. Therefore, with a distributed system, if the server has problems, the other users/clients have backups of the data to possibly help restore the server. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a type of distributed version control system. Each client has a backup of the data. Because Git uses a “snapshot” type system, it prevents the overwriting of a file. There is saved snapshots of each version when there have been changes. It is all stored locally though, there is no retrieval from another system, it is all right on your personal system. It is also a very reliable source. It detects corruption or issues with information or issues with transferring information and can prevent it and notify the user, through checksum. It is a very good learning tool, users can add and change things to data or files and not have to worry that if something goes wrong there is no way to fix it or go back to figure out where it went wrong. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are three basic steps when it comes to Git commands. Add, commit, and push. Within those three there are other commands to use those basic steps. Git Add commands to add all recently changed files to the staging area. Git Commit commands that all changes are set and sent to the repository. Finally, Git Push commands the changes to be sent from the local repository to the remote repository. With these three commands, data can be used, utilized, and changed throughout the different stages of a project. The user can move throughout Git from the remote repository to the local one. From there movements can occur between different stages to change or do different actions to projects, data, etc. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Getting a Git Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Git project or repository can be obtained by either taking an existing project and import it, or by cloning a repository from another server. To track a project in Git, the user needs to go to the directory. Doing so creates a container of all the necessary files, this is called a Git repository skeleton. Then continue on with an initial commit with add and commit commands.  On the other hand, to clone a repository, use the command git clone, creating a directory, initializing another inside it, grabs all the data and the latest version. There are further, more specific, commands to initialize and utilize the information collected. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Recording Repository Changes</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When changes are made to a repository, committing snapshots and recording the state of the project needs to occur. To help do so, it is important to determine a file’s state and a user can utilize the status command. Then to track it, a user can use the add git command, it will show that the file is then tracked and staged to be committed. The statuses and output information that git provides after commands are made can be fairly extensive. To see the status in a shortened version, users can command short status. In comparison, to view the status with more detail, users can command git diff. Finally, to commit the changes, users can utilize the git commit command. All files that are staged and have the proper status will commit, unstaged files, that have not been commanded with git add, will not. The snapshot of the staged version will be recorded. The unstaged files will simply be modified, just not snapshotted, the user would just need to commit and add those to create snapshots of them as well. </p>
